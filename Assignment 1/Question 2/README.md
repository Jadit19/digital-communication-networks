# Assignment 1: Question 2

## Setup

Make sure that your mobile phone and computer / laptop are on the same network. Else, this won't work. Open up a terminal and navigate to this directory. Now, execure the command:

```sh
python3 server.py
```

Follow the terminal output, entering whatever it asks. Input the terminal output into the UDP Monitor application. By this, I mean the server IP and server Port that gets printed out.
