# Assignment 1: Question 1

## Setup

### 1. TCP Client-Server connection

Open up two separate terminals and navigate to this directory in both of them. In the first one, run the command:

```sh
python3 TCP_Server.py
```

This starts the TCP Server. To establish a client connection to this server, fire up a TCP Client in the other terminal using the following command:

```sh
python3 TCP_Client.py
```

### 2. UDP Client-Server connection

Open up two separate terminals and navigate to this directory in both of them. In the first one, run the command:

```sh
python3 UDP_Server.py
```

This starts the UDP Server. To establish a client connection to this server, fire up a UDP Client in the other terminal using the following command:

```sh
python3 UDP_Client.py
```
