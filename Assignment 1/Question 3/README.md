# Assignment 1: Question 2

## Setup

In case of gmail mail server, you are going to need an app password, not your email password in order to send the email. Refer [this](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) for more information on what is an app password and how to create one for gmail.

Once this is done change line #71 and #72 of [script.py](./script.py) to suit your needs. Once this is done, run the program using:

```sh
python3 script.py
```
